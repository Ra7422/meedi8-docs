# Duo Mediation Flow

Here's what happens during a duo mediation session.

## Overview

A duo mediation has three main phases:

1. **Individual Coaching** (Each person: 15-30 min)
2. **Joint Mediation** (30-60 min)
3. **Resolution & Report** (5-10 min)

---

## Phase 1: Individual Coaching

### What Happens
Both participants have separate, private coaching sessions with Meedi:
- Share your perspective
- Identify feelings and needs
- Prepare for the conversation

### Privacy
- Your coaching is **completely private**
- The other person doesn't see your session
- Only a brief summary is shared (with your approval)

---

## Phase 2: Joint Mediation

### Entering the Room
When both are ready:
- You'll both see a notification
- Click to enter the mediation room
- Meedi welcomes you both

### Turn-Taking Structure
The conversation follows a structured format:

1. **Person A shares** - Uninterrupted
2. **Meedi summarizes** - Reflects what was said
3. **Person B responds** - Their turn to share
4. **Meedi facilitates** - Guides toward understanding
5. **Repeat** - Continue until resolution

### Rules of the Room
- One person speaks at a time
- No interrupting
- Focus on feelings and needs
- Stay respectful

### If Things Get Heated
Meedi monitors for:
- Harsh language
- Blame/accusations
- Escalation

If detected, Meedi will:
1. Pause the conversation
2. Acknowledge the intensity
3. Help both parties re-center
4. Resume when ready

---

## Phase 3: Resolution

### Working Toward Agreement
Meedi helps you:
- Find common ground
- Acknowledge each other's needs
- Create action items

### Ending the Session
You can end when:
- You've reached understanding
- You've agreed on next steps
- You both feel heard

### Taking Breaks
At any time, either person can:
- Request a pause
- Take a breather
- Return when ready

## What If...

### The Other Person Gets Upset?
Meedi intervenes and helps de-escalate. You can also take a break.

### We Can't Agree?
That's okay. The goal is understanding, not forced agreement. Meedi will help you find partial common ground.

### I Need to Leave?
You can exit anytime. The session saves your progress.
