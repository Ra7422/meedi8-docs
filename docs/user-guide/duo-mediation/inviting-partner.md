# Inviting a Partner

Ready to bring someone else into the mediation? Here's how to invite them.

## Getting the Invite Link

After completing your coaching phase:

1. You'll see an **"Invite Partner"** button
2. Click to generate a unique link
3. Copy the link

## Sharing the Link

Send the link via:
- **Email** - Most reliable
- **Text/SMS** - Quick and direct
- **Messaging apps** - WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.

### Sample Message

> "Hi [Name], I've started a mediation session on Meedi8 to help us work through [topic]. Would you be willing to join? Here's the link: [paste link]
>
> It's a guided conversation with an AI mediator. You'll have your own private coaching session first. Let me know if you have questions!"

## What They'll Experience

1. **Create Account** (if new) - Same easy signup
2. **Read Overview** - Brief explanation of the process

You'll get an email when they're ready.
