- **Improve listening** by quieting mental chatter

### For Personal Growth

- **Improve focus** and mental clarity
- **Build emotional resilience** over time
- **Better sleep quality** with regular practice

## The Box Breathing Technique

Meedi8 uses the scientifically-backed **box breathing** method:

| Phase | Duration | What to Do |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Inhale** | 4 seconds | Breathe in slowly through your nose |
| **Hold** | 4 seconds | Hold your breath gently |
| **Exhale** | 4 seconds | Release slowly through your mouth |

One complete cycle takes 12 seconds.
