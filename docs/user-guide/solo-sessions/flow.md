# Solo Session Flow

Here's what to expect in a solo session with Meedi.

## Overview

A typical solo session takes **15-30 minutes** and follows this structure:

1. **Describe the Situation** (5 min)
2. **Identify Feelings** (5 min)
3. **Discover Needs** (5 min)
4. **Prepare Communication** (5-10 min)
5. **Summary & Report** (2 min)

## Phase 1: Describe the Situation

### What Happens
Meedi asks you to share what's on your mind. Just talk (or type) about:
- What happened
- Who's involved
- What's bothering you

### Tips
- Be honest and specific
- Include relevant context
- Don't worry about being "fair" yet

## Phase 2: Identify Feelings

### What Happens
Meedi helps you name your emotions:
- "It sounds like you're feeling frustrated..."
- "Are you also feeling hurt or disappointed?"
- "What else comes up for you?"

### Why This Matters
Naming emotions:
- Reduces their intensity
- Creates clarity
- Prepares for constructive dialogue

## Phase 3: Discover Needs

### What Happens
Meedi digs deeper to find underlying needs:
- "What do you need in this situation?"
- "What would make things better for you?"
- "What's most important here?"

### Common Needs
- Respect
- Understanding
- Fairness
- Connection
- Autonomy
- Safety

## Phase 4: Prepare Communication

### What Happens
Meedi helps you craft constructive language:
- Reframe complaints as needs
- Practice "I" statements
- Prepare for different responses

### Example Transformation
**Before:** "You never listen to me!"
**After:** "When I don't feel heard, I feel frustrated because I need connection and understanding."
