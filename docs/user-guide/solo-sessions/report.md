# Understanding Your Solo Report

After each session, Meedi generates a comprehensive report. Here's how to read and use it.

## Report Sections

### Situation Summary
A brief, neutral summary of what you discussed. Useful for:
- Reviewing later
- Sharing context (if you choose)
- Tracking patterns over time

### Feelings Identified
A list of emotions that came up during your session:
- Primary feelings (strongest)
- Secondary feelings (underlying)
- How they connect to the situation

### Underlying Needs
The core needs driving your feelings:
- What you need in this situation
- What values are at stake
- What would help you feel better

### Communication Suggestions
Constructive ways to express yourself:
- "I" statements
- Non-blaming language
- Specific requests

### Action Items
Recommended next steps:
- Continue to duo mediation?
- Have a direct conversation?
- Schedule follow-up reflection?
