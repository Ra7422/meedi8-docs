# When to Use Solo Sessions

Solo sessions give you private space to work through your thoughts with Meedi before (or instead of) involving another person.

## Best Use Cases

### Preparing for a Difficult Conversation
Use a solo session to:
- Organize your thoughts
- Identify what you really want to communicate
- Practice expressing yourself constructively

### Processing Strong Emotions
When you're feeling overwhelmed:
- Work through anger, frustration, or hurt
- Gain clarity before reacting
- Find calm before engaging

### When the Other Person Isn't Available
If you can't have a duo session:
- The other person refuses to participate
- They're not ready yet
- You need to process on your own timeline

### Self-Reflection
Even without conflict, solo sessions help with:
- Understanding your communication patterns
- Practicing NVC techniques
- Personal growth
