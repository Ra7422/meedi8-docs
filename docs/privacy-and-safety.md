## AI Ethics

### Neutrality
Our AI mediator is designed to be **completely neutral**. It:

- Uses evidence-based NVC techniques

### Limitations
The AI is **not**:
- A licensed therapist
- A legal advisor
- An emergency service
- A replacement for professional help

### Transparency
- We clearly label AI-generated content
- You can see how the AI reaches conclusions
- We explain NVC techniques as we use them
