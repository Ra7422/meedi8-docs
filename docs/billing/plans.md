## Frequently Asked Questions

### What counts as an "active session"?
An active session is any mediation that isn't completed or deleted. Once you mark a session as resolved or delete it, it frees up that slot.

### Can I switch plans?
Yes! Upgrade or downgrade anytime from Settings. Upgrades take effect immediately; downgrades take effect at the end of your billing cycle.

### What payment methods do you accept?
We accept all major credit/debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex), Apple Pay, and Google Pay through our secure Stripe payment gateway.

### Is my payment secure?
Yes, all payments are processed securely through Stripe. We never store your card details.

### Do you offer annual billing?
Yes! Annual billing is available for both PLUS (£90/year) and PRO (£180/year) plans. You'll save approximately 37% compared to monthly billing.

### Can I get a refund?
We offer a 7-day refund policy for first purchases. See our [Cancellation Policy](/billing/cancellation) for details.
