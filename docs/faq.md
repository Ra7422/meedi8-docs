# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is Meedi8?

Meedi8 is an AI-powered mediation platform that helps people resolve conflicts using Nonviolent Communication (NVC) principles. Our AI mediator guides conversations toward understanding and resolution.

### Is my conversation private?

Yes. Your conversations are encrypted and never shared with third parties. Only you and your mediation partner (in duo sessions) can see the conversation content. See our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy) for details.

### Who is the AI mediator?

Meedi8 uses advanced AI from Anthropic (Claude) and OpenAI, trained in conflict resolution and NVC techniques. The AI remains neutral and guides both parties toward understanding - it never takes sides.

### Can I use Meedi8 alone?

Yes! **Solo sessions** let you work through your thoughts privately with Meedi before (or instead of) involving another person. Many users find solo sessions helpful for:
- Processing emotions before a difficult conversation
- Preparing what they want to say
- Getting clarity on their own feelings and needs

### Is Meedi8 a replacement for therapy?

No. Meedi8 is a communication tool, not a mental health service. While our AI is trained in NVC and conflict resolution, it's not a licensed therapist. For serious mental health concerns, please consult a qualified professional.

## Session Questions

### How long does a mediation session take?

Sessions typically take **30-60 minutes**, but there's no time limit. You can pause and resume at any time using the break feature.

### What if the other person doesn't respond?

They'll receive email reminders. If they don't join within **7 days**, the invitation expires and you can start a new session.

### Can I save my progress and come back later?

Yes! Sessions are automatically saved. You can close the browser and return anytime - just log back in and continue where you left off.

### What happens if the conversation gets heated?

Meedi8 actively monitors for harsh language and will intervene if things get too heated. The AI will:
1. Pause the conversation
2. Acknowledge the intensity
3. Help both parties re-center on their feelings and needs
4. Resume when ready

### Can I import chat history from other apps?

Yes! You can import conversations from **Telegram** to give Meedi context about your situation. This helps the AI understand the history and provide more relevant guidance.
